Task1:
The regular expression ^[a-zA-Z0-9]{8,12}$ matches strings that are 8 to 12 characters long and contain only alphanumeric characters (letters and digits). It ensures the string starts and ends with these characters, with no spaces or special characters allowed. In this code, it is used to validate passwords.

Password: password123 - Valid: True
Password: 12345 - Valid: False
Password: validpassword - Valid: False
Password: TooLongPassword123 - Valid: False
Password: short - Valid: False
Password: 12345678 - Valid: True
Password: password123! - Valid: False
Password: valid123 - Valid: True

Task2:
The regex \b(\d{2})-(\d{2})-(\d{4})\b is used to find dates in the format dd-mm-yyyy. \d{2} matches two digits for day and month. \d{4} matches four digits for the year. \b ensures word boundaries to avoid partial matches (like 11-1-2022). The code extracts these dates, converts them into yyyy-mm-dd format, and replaces them in the text.

Original dates and converted dates:
Original: 12-03-2021 -> Converted: 2021-03-12
Original: 20-05-2022 -> Converted: 2022-05-20
Original: 15-06-2022 -> Converted: 2022-06-15
Original: 05-11-2022 -> Converted: 2022-11-05
Original: 01-12-2022 -> Converted: 2022-12-01

Modified text:

The project started on 2021-03-12 and ended on 2022-05-20.
There was a meeting on 2022-06-15, and another on 2022-11-05.
Final reports were due by 2022-12-01.

Task3:
The regex matches a typical email address that starts and ends with a word boundary (whitespace or punctuation), has an alphanumeric username (with allowed special characters), and contains a valid domain name with at least one period separating the domain and a valid TLD (like .com, .org, etc.).

Raw emails found: ['support@company.co', 'info@website.co.uk']
Cleaned emails: []

Modified text (emails replaced with [EMAIL]):

Here are some email addresses: john.doe@example.com, jane_doe123@subdomain.mail.org.
You can also reach out to [EMAIL] or [EMAIL] for inquiries.
Random data: 1a2b3c and invalid email like test@com without domain.
