Explain what changes the program makes to the input.

First the program pulls the transaction messages from the file, matches each line to find card numbers using regex.
The program then modifies the first and last 4 of the card number to mask it. After this, the program attempts to gather
the issuer of the card using regex that checks the first 4, 5, 3, 6 digits of the card number to assign them to be a Visa,
Mastercard, Amex, or Discover card, respectively. Finally, the program outputs the count of each card assigned to their
card issuer.
