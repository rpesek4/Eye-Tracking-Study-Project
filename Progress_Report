Data Analyzing:
We have a couple of different types of data to go through.
We plan to use scripts similar to assignment 1 and 2 to proccess the raw eye tracking data into a more useable form.
The time to complete data is very simple, as it is just timing the particapants for each task.
For the survey data we plan to compare the partipant responses to our own answer key and mark it correct or incorrect.
The other survey asks participants to rate the difficulty of the tasks, where we will take the average of the responses to rank difficulty.
