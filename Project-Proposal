Title:
How do programmers understand regular expressions via eye tracking?

Abstract:
We want to use eye tracking on participants while they examine uses of regular expressions in code, in order to see if there are any notable patterns of behaviors.
This could help understand best practices for using regular expressions in code so that it is more readable.

Motivation:
Understanding how programmers read examples of regular expressions could help in understanding the best way to format code that uses regular expressions.
